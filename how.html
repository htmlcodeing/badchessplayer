    <h3 align="center">How to set up chess</h3>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>Chess, is a two player game, and can be won by anyone. The first thing you have to do is make sure that the chess table is set up so that the white corner piece is placed at the bottom right of the board. In chess the board will allways be checkered when playing. The there are 8 pawns for chess and they will go in the second row of the board. The rooks will go in the corners, in the first row, and the knights go next to them. The bishops will go next to the knights. The queen will always be on the matching color,so if you have a white queen it will go on the white spot. The king will always be placed next to the queen, and this will also follow for the other player.</p>

    <h3 align="center">How the characters move in chess.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> The pawn is most likely the first piece that most chess players will move. When a player moves the pawn, on the first move every pawn in its starting block can move 1 or 2 spaces forward, and can only move forward. It can only move forward by 1 block after the first move. If there is a chess piece in front of it, it can not move until the piece in front of it moves. Although their is an exception for the pawns moving to the block diagonal in front of it, and this can only happen when your opponents piece is in that diagonal spot. When this happens the pawn can move into that spot to take out the piece diagonal to it. The pawn <b>cannot</b> take out any of the opponent's pieces in front of it.
   <br>  After the pawn would be the rook, which looks like a castle pillar. The rook can only move straight in any of the 4 directions(fowards, right, left, and backwards. If one of your own pieces is in its way it can no longer move. It cannot move diagonal at all even if there is an opponents piece in that spot.. The way to take out peices from the player is to move the rook until it can move forward, and the other opponent's piece is in one of the four directions.
    <br> After the rook would come the knights, wich look like a hoarse. The kmights are the only pieces in the game that are allowed to jump over any and all of the pieces on the board. The hoarse can move in a L shape, by moving 2 spaces forward in any of the 4 directions, and then going into the spot that is to the left or right of the one that you landed on. The knight will never land on the same color that it is occupying. If one of the spaces where the knight can go is occupied by the players pieces, then they cannot move into this spot.(this applies to all of the pieces).
    <br> After the knights there would be the bishops. The bishops can only move into diagonal spaces. The bishops can move in all 4 diagonal directions, and can only move diagonal when there isn't a piece blocking it, or it can keep going diagonal until it can take out the opponents pieces.
    <br> After the bishops would be the queen. The queen is the most powerful piece in the game, because it can move in all 8 of the directions. It can move straight and diagonal, so it is like the rooks and the bishops combined. The last piece is the king itself, and the most important piece in the game. It can only move 1 space, but in every direction.</p>

    <h3 align=center>How to win in chess</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>To win in chess, you need to take out the <b>king</b> piece in chess. As I said before the king is the most important piece in the game. Another important thing to know is if one of your pawns gets to the other end of the board, it can be replaced by any one of the pieces that aren't pawns. If one of the players pieces gets into a spot on the board, when they can take the king the player has to say check to the opponent. When this happenes the opponent either has to move the king, or put one of their other pieces in front of the king to save it. When the game is won, or it is obvious that one of the players will win within a couple of moves no matter where the other player moves then they will have to call out checkmate. There is one more term that begginers should know of, and that is stalemate, which is a draw. A stalemate happens when the king is safe, but cannot move into any spots, because it will get taken. The king cannot move into check. So if the king cannot move into any spaces without being in check, then the game will end in a stalemate. </p>
